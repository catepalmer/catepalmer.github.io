        How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way 
        you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I struggled with this quite a bit - it was difficult not 
        to get caught up in trying to make my blog look perfect, 
        especially given that I lacked the skills to easily fix 
        really glaring problems in the CSS code (and would end up 
        spending a long time trying to figure out how to fix these). 
        Overall I think I could’ve done a lot better with this aspect 
        of my redesign and rebuild, largely through having more of a 
        plan and method for the process itself (as it was tricky having 
        limited time and only being able to work on the redesign in 
        short bursts, but then not remembering what I’d been doing the 
        last time when I finally came back to it). I think in future 
        I’d like to approach this kind of exercise with more of a plan 
        for my process and with quite clear note-taking for tracking 
        this along the way.

        What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2 
        of Search Inside Yourself?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before reading chapter 2, I thought of meditation as a relaxation 
        practice that was fairly aimless aside from the relaxation 
        produced by the exercise - I knew it was beneficial in reducing 
        stress levels and promoting wellness, but I didn’t really think 
        of it as a practice with a purpose aside from these side-benefits.

      <h3>
        What new things have you learnt about meditation?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I really like the way Tan explains meditations as a means of 
        training the mind, with the goal being the ability to produce 
        and maintain the kind of focus that leads to greater self-awareness 
        and insight, and the way he likens this ‘training’ to weight 
        training (with growth resulting from the overcoming of resistance). 
        This made a lot of sense to me in terms of the tangible aims of 
        meditation and measurable effects it produces.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you? 
        Any other musings?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I liked Tan’s advice to do whatever allows you to feel most calm 
        and relaxed in terms of posture and whether your eyes are open or 
        closed - as someone with a back condition that makes it very hard 
        for me to sit without back support without experiencing pain, usual 
        suggestions for meditation posture don’t work well for me, and I much 
        prefer to lie down - Tan’s ‘Do what works best for you’ seemed to 
        speak directly to this. And I like the idea of starting with an 
        intention, e.g. to reduce stress or increase your own wellbeing - 
        those kinds of intentions seemed to specifically speak to the 
        self-care and self-compassion that are intrinsic parts of meditation. 
        I also liked the way Tan says that because meditation is training 
        (with the implication being that when you start training at something 
        you’re not necessarily going to be very good), and self-compassion is 
        an essential part of meditation, there’s no such thing as a failed 
        meditation - and being harsh with yourself when your mind wanders as 
        you’re trying to meditate is beside the point.
