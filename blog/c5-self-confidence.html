           What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Both mindfulness and self-awareness involve being able to retain an 
        awareness and attention that’s slightly outside of your stream of 
        thought and emotion, so that you’re aware of your emotions and thoughts 
        as experiences that are passing through you, rather than 
        over-identifying with them. Both also involve being able to see thoughts 
        and emotions with clarity. There’s a direct link between mindfulness and 
        self-awareness in that the more you practise mindfulness, the more 
        self-aware you’re likely to become  (through being able to apply greater 
        clarity to your emotional experience).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body 
        Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I already have a regular journalling practice (largely for similar reasons 
        to what Tan outlines as its benefits - increased clarity about my thoughts 
        and emotions and ability to work with them to solve problems I’m 
        experiencing), but the technique he suggests is a bit different from what 
        I usually do (in that he advocates a kind of stream-of-consciousness 
        journalling), so I decided to try it. I found it helpful to just get my 
        thoughts and feelings down on paper - almost like doing a messy first 
        draft that allowed me to see the basic material I was working with in 
        terms of what was going on in my mind and what I was feeling fixated on. 
        By itself this gave me a feeling of a slight distance from and objectivity 
        around my thoughts and emotions - which gave me a sense of calm and not 
        being as caught up in or anxious about the things that were running 
        through my mind.

      <h3>
        What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I found this section really resonated with me and echoed quite a few other 
        ideas I’d encountered in my efforts to develop more self-awareness and 
        mastery over my emotions (which is something I’ve been very interested in 
        for a few years now). I like the idea that developing self-awareness 
        allows you to go from seeing your emotions as existential to seeing them 
        as experiential, and being able to work productively with them rather 
        than being unable to do anything about them. This really resonated with 
        me and made me feel quite excited about the possibilities presented by 
        this way of thinking. I also think it’s a much more accurate way of 
        looking at your emotions than seeing them as essential to who you are. I 
        really liked the metaphor of thoughts and emotions being like clouds, 
        and our core self being like the sky - this was a really comforting 
        thought, as the clear sky is always still there even if it’s hidden 
        temporarily by the clouds, and learning tools that allow you to access it 
        more easily provide a lot of hope for being able to not be overwhelmed by 
        your emotions and thoughts.
