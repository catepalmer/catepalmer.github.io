          What is grid based design?
      </h3>
      <p>
          Grid-based design involves building the page layout of a 
          website on an underlying framework of columns (usually 12 
          in total) and rows so that the page can be divided easily 
          into sections and the content laid out in a way that’s 
          visually appealing and easy to follow.
      </p>
      <h3>
          What’s all the hype about responsive webpages?
      </h3>
      <p>
          A responsive webpage displays differently depending on the 
          size of the screen it’s viewed on, and is built with a 
          variety of screen types (and what would be easiest and most 
          visually appealing to view on each of them) in mind - e.g. 
          laptops, tablets, phones, and desktops.
      </p>
      <h3>
          What is semantic structure?
      </h3>
      <p>
          Semantic structure is the structure determined by the 
          different elements and their functions and order of 
          prominence in an HTML file - e.g. h1, h2, h3, etc. Elements 
          are named according to their function, which makes the HTML 
          make more semantic sense.
