      <h3>
          Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and 
          the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical 
          friend?
      </h3>
      <p>
          If you think of a web page as being like a person’s body, 
          HTML would be the skeleton, CSS would provide the surface 
          features like skin and hair, and the DOM would be the 
          person’s genetic material (giving instructions for how 
          everything fits together).
      </p>
      <h3>
          What is meant by boxifying design?
      </h3>
      <p>
          Boxifying design basically just means dividing a webpage 
          into smaller and smaller boxes so that different features 
          can be applied separately to them (e.g. CSS can be written 
          that applies to the whole body of the page, or to smaller 
          boxes within it).
      </p>
      <h3>
          What is the box model?
      </h3>
      <p>
          The box model is a way of specifying the size, shape, etc 
          of various features of different ‘boxes’ on the page - the 
          content within them, the padding around the content that’s 
          still within the box's borders, the borders themselves, and 
          the margins around these borders that stop other boxes from 
          sitting right next to the first box’s borders.
