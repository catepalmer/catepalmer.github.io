          What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?
      </h3>
      <p>
          A responsive site is one whose layout and design change as the 
          browser is resized and on devices with different-sized screens. 
          Generally a responsive site has been designed to be user-
          friendly and aesthetically pleasing for various different screen 
          sizes, and it may have added features on larger screen sizes.
      </p>
      <h3>
          What is mobile first design, and why is it important?
      </h3>
      <p>
           Mobile first design is responsive web design that’s designed 
           first of all for a mobile-sized screens, and then extra 
           features are added/the layout is changed/more code is run for 
           progressively larger screen sizes. It’s important because 
           starting from the constraints of a smaller screen means that 
           the site must be designed to look good and have all its basic 
           features (but not excess, non-necessary features) present on 
           smaller screens, and then at larger screen sizes additional 
           features and more complex formatting can be added in 
           progression. This order for design involves building something 
           from its smallest, most basic version first - and making this 
           attractive and functional - before adding extra features, and 
           means that smaller screen sizes aren’t compromised as much as 
           they would be if a desktop-first approach were taken (where 
           they might be treated as afterthoughts and not be as functional 
           or attractive as they would be if a mobile-first approach were 
           taken). The other important thing about it is that larger 
           screen sizes are generally correlated with more processing 
           power, so the extra code that only applies to larger screen 
           sizes is only run on systems that can handle it while still 
           retaining their speed and efficiency (whereas if the opposite 
           approach were taken, mobile devices may have to run a lot of 
           unnecessary code).

      <h3>
          What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?
      </h3>
      <p>
          A framework is a collection of files that provide a 
          pre-designed code structure (e.g. using JavaScript, HTML, 
          and CSS) that can make it much easier and more efficient to 
          build a site with impressive appearance and functionality 
          without having to write all the code from scratch. One of the 
          drawbacks of using frameworks, however, is that they tend to 
          create limitations in terms of what you can do and how you 
          can do it, and if you want to add features that aren’t 
          straightforward to add as part of the framework, it can be 
          difficult to do this.

      <h3>
            What is a wireframe, and why do we use it?
      </h3>
      <p>
            A wireframe is an image that’s been sketched or constructed 
            using a wireframe programme that captures the basic 
            functional elements and intended layout of a web page. It’s 
            similar to the blueprint an architect uses to construct a 
            house in that it provides a plan for how the site will look 
            and function. We use wireframes because they help us 
            visualise how a page will look and plan for usability, 
            attractiveness, and how users’ eyes will naturally scan the 
            page.

      <h3>
            What aspects of your wireframes did you find difficult 
            to implement, and why?
      </h3>
      <p>
            I actually totally ended up building my site to look quite 
            different from the wireframes I drew up, as I decided on 
            an image I wanted for my background and then built the 
            site around this. So perhaps what I found most difficult 
            to implement about my wireframes was actually sticking 
            to them! I think I possibly find it hard to visualise a 
            site design when there are elements (e.g. a background 
            image) that I haven’t decided on yet, as these seem to 
            affect how I envisage things quite heavily.
