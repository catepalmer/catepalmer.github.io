      <h3>
        In the JavaScript language, describe all the use cases for each of:
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Parentheses ()
      </h3>
      <p>
        Parentheses () are used in JavaScript when defining a function (parameters 
        are enclosed inside the parentheses). A function is a block of code that, 
        when called, will be executed (without having to retype all the code the 
        function defined). When calling a function, arguments must be placed inside 
        the parentheses as inputs. Parentheses are also used in if/else conditional 
        chains and loops.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Brackets []
      </h3>
      <p>
        Brackets are used in JavaScript to indicate arrays - collections of variables 
        stored at different indices within the array. They are also used to access 
        properties of an object or a particular index of an array.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Braces {}
      </h3>
      <p>
        Curly braces are used in JavaScript when defining a function (the code to be 
        executed when the function is called will be contained within the curly 
        braces), and similarly when creating looping or conditional if/else statements 
        (the code to be executed as part of the loop/conditional will be contained 
        within the curly braces). They are also used when declaring an object 
        (properties of the object will be contained within the curly braces).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Single '' and Double "" Quotes
      </h3>
      <p>
        Single and doubles quotes can be used interchangeably in JavaScript as long 
        as they are used consistently (i.e. if a particular string starts with a 
        single quote it must also end with a single quote, and if any further quotes 
        are contained within it they must be the opposite type). Quotes are used to 
        enclose a string.
