        When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a 
        disproportionate emotional response?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I find that for me, one of my triggers when programming is coming 
        across an error or problem that I don’t understand and don’t know 
        where I should look or what I should be researching in order to 
        solve it. I think some of this comes from the fact that I’m so new 
        to programming and don’t really have any kind of method yet for 
        solving problems I get stuck on (since in other areas of my life 
        that I have much more background and skill in, I don’t feel completely 
        at a loss when I come across a problem, as I tend to have methods I use 
        to solve such problems and paths towards learning more about what I need 
        to know that I feel confident in relying on). When this happens I tend 
        to feel frustrated very quickly and also helpless and defeated - a mix 
        of anger and sadness.

        How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, 
        Notice, Reflect, Respond)?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I like this exercise and I think to a degree I try to do something 
        similar a lot of the time when I have strong emotional reactions. 
        I’m not sure I’ll remember it by the acronym and ‘Siberian North 
        Railroad’ though.
