          What learnings did you take from the chapter?
      </h3>
      <p>
          Emotional intelligence consists of a set of skills that can 
          be learned - it’s not an innate, fixed attribute of a person. 
          It’s also inextricably linked to things like happiness, 
          resilience, and optimism. The key skills it consists of 
          include self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, 
          and social skills.

          How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
      </h3>
      <p>
          I found it easy and very enjoyable - I think reading the 
          chapter in some way mentally prepared me to be able to 
          access a state of mindfulness quite effortlessly. I was just 
          very disappointed when my alarm went off to let me know the 
          two minutes was up!
