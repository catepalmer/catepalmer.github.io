        Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on 
        a simple problem:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This has happened a number of times to me. I can’t remember the 
        specifics, but there was one time where I couldn’t get my code 
        to work and it was because of a fairly straightforward syntax 
        error. I didn’t realise that loading the page I was working on 
        in my browser and going into the console would tell me what line 
        of my Javascript file the error was on, and I ended up asking for 
        help from one of my peers and having them find this for me by 
        using the console. I found this process quite frustrating, as I 
        didn’t really know what problem-solving techniques to use other 
        than asking for help from others. It would be good to get more of 
        an idea of standard techniques for figuring out what’s going on 
        when code doesn’t run properly (e.g. loading the page and using 
        the console, which is one thing I learned from this).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you solved a 
        problem in an elegant way:
      </h3>
      <p>
        To be honest no examples spring to mind of when I’ve done this!
      </p>
      <h3>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving 
        techniques and process:
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Pseudocode
      </h3>
      <p>
        I don’t feel that confident yet using pseudocode, but it makes a 
        lot of intuitive sense to me as a problem-solving technique and 
        I’d like to start using it more.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Trying something
      </h3>
      <p>
        I do this one quite a lot, but I often don’t have much success 
        with it!
      </p>
      <h3>
        Rubber ducky method
      </h3>
      <p>
        Again, I haven’t used this method much, but it makes a lot of 
        sense to me and I’d like to try to start using it more - I’ve 
        found it helpful when I’ve tried to explain what I’m doing to 
        other people, so even when there are no other people are maybe 
        it would be helpful to try to explain things to an inanimate 
        object.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Reading error messages
      </h3>
      <p>
        This one has been the most useful technique to me so far, and 
        my confidence in using it is definitely growing.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Console.logging
      </h3>
      <p>
        I haven’t really tried this technique much, but maybe it would be 
        worth trying more often.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Googling
      </h3>
      <p>
        This one has definitely been helpful for me so far, and I’m growing 
        in confidence with it.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Asking your peers for help
      </h3>
      <p>
        I do this quite a lot! So far my peers have been pretty helpful. A 
        particular shout-out to Zach from the Kokako cohort, who’s been 
        really onto it and helpful with my coding problems.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Asking coaches for help
      </h3>
      <p>
        I haven’t really resorted to this one much yet, but I probably will 
        at some point if none of my peers reply to me when I ask for help!
      </p>
      <h3>
        Improving your process with reflection
      </h3>
      <p>
        I’ve been a bit too impatient to do much of this so far, but I think 
        it would be really helpful if I slowed down and did it more.
      </p>
