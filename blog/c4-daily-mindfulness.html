           What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
      </h3>
      <p>
           I did this exercise with my mum via Skype, and I found it really 
           interesting as it cemented for me that some of the improvements 
           we’ve seen in our relationship over the past year or so have 
           come about partly because we’ve navigated some conflicts with 
           each other in a way that has seemed to echo Tan’s definitions 
           of listening, looping and dipping, and we’ve generally been more 
           attentive when listening to each other since then in a way that 
           I think has something in common with Tan’s definition of 
           mindfulness (and I feel like I’ve also had more meta-awareness 
           of when I haven’t engaged with her in a very mindful way). I 
           also think what Tan says about these techniques being 
           particularly helpful in navigating conflict rings very true for 
           me, as there have been a couple of other major conflicts I’ve had 
           with people in the past year that have resulted in the opposite 
           of a closer or better relationship, and in one case in particular 
           the absence of things like looping and dipping (or their 
           equivalent) on the other person’s part was largely what made me 
           decide the conflict was unnavigable and I needed to distance 
           myself from that person, as I simply didn’t feel like I was being 
           listened to. So I think the techniques Tan talks about, and the 
           general concept of mindful engagement with others, has wider 
           implications for the health of relationships and their ability to 
           bounce back from conflict. I think my mum found the exercise 
           amusing but helpful, and for her it also seemed to echo some 
           things we’ve been trying to do more with each other lately.

      <h3>
           Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain 
           your practice?
      </h3>
      <p>
           I really like the idea of doing less than you can, and Tan’s 
           focus on making a practice sustainable and not something that 
           feels like a burden. This is something I feel like I’ve already 
           grappled with a bit, as I had a tendency when I was younger to 
           not cut myself any slack and to expect too much of myself (and 
           then I’d predictably burn out and be unable to sustain a routine 
           with what I was trying to do).
