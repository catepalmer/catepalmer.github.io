        How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Looking at life and the different kinds of happiness through this lens, 
        it seems clear that a deeper sense of happiness isn’t really about 
        pleasure or ‘chasing the next high’. It seems like it could be good to 
        take a kind of top-down approach, starting with purpose and then working 
        down from there, as Tan suggests - allowing passion (in the form of flow) 
        to come from doing work that’s in alignment with your higher purpose, 
        and allowing fleeting moments of pleasure to come to you through trying 
        to follow purpose and passion.
      </p>
      <h3>
        From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your 
        core values? What do you stand for?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Living with integrity towards myself and others, being truthful, striving 
        to learn and grow continuously.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I found this exercise interesting - coming to the deliberate experiencing 
        of the emotions associated with failure and success through the framework 
        of the exercise and the book itself, I found myself less caught up in and 
        overwhelmed by the emotions associated with failure, and I also felt less 
        caught up in the emotions associated with success in a grandiose or self-
        congratulatory way. Both just seemed like things I’d needed to experience 
        in order to learn and grow, and for that I felt grateful for both and able 
        to hold them with some degree of calm.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any other musings?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I had read about a lot of this research before, but it was still really 
        useful to ground myself in it again and read it as summarised by Tan. I 
        really enjoyed the exercise of writing about how you envision your life 
        five years from now and found it genuinely really useful in helping me 
        think about how I want to go forward into the future and what I want to 
        focus my energy on in order to get my life on the track I envision for it.
