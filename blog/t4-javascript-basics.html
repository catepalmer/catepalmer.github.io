          How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
      </h3>
      <p>
          JavaScript, unlike HTML and CSS (which are used to create the 
          structure and style of web pages respectively), is a programming 
          language that allows you to make a web page interactive, by 
          specifying the behaviour of the page based on user inputs etc.
      </p>
      <h3>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from 
          everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
      </h3>
      <p>
          To use the example of baking a cake by following a recipe, control 
          flow is the order in which you need to follow the steps of the 
          recipe in order for the cake to turn out as expected, whereas an 
          example of a loop could be seen in individual recipe instructions, 
          e.g. measuring ingredients (e.g. while the amount of flour added 
          is less than the number of cups specified in the recipe, add more 
          until it equals that amount).
      </p>
      <h3>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </h3>
      <p>
          Arrays essentially contain lists of items of data that can be accessed 
          by specifying the number of the data point (with the first item in the 
          array being data point 0), whereas objects contain data that are 
          stored as belonging to properties that are specified when the object 
          is defined (and need to be accessed by referencing the property that 
          that data belongs to).
      </p>
      <h3>
          Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
      </h3>
      <p>
          Functions are pre-written pieces of code that allow you to specify some 
          sequence of actions that are carried out when that function is called 
          (with parameters specified that allow you to input specific values as 
          arguments when you call the function). They’re useful because they can 
          be repeated using new arguments/values at different points in the code 
          and mean you don’t have to write that piece of code over again, which 
          makes your code more efficient.
